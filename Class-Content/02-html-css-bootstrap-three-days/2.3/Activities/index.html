			<h4><a name="first">1.1 Only you could make those words cute.</a></h4>
			<p>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. <strong> I'm Dexter.</strong> <em> Boo.</em> I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>

			<h4><a name="second">1.2 I'm really more an apartment person.</a></h4>
			<p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. This man is a knight in shining armor.</p>
			<p>I'm really more an apartment person. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>

			<h4><a name="third">1.3 I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</a></h4>
			<p>I'm really more an apartment person. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Only you could make those words cute. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.</p>
			<p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You're a killer. I catch killers. Tell him time is of the essence. I have a dark side, too.</p>
			<p>You look…perfect. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm generally confused most of the time.</p>
			<p>He taught me a code. To survive. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Keep your mind limber. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>
			<p>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. He taught me a code. To survive. Makes me a … scientist. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</p>
			<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. You're a killer. I catch killers. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>
			<p>I'm really more an apartment person. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm really more an apartment person. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>
			<p>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm really more an apartment person. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>
			<p>I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Tell him time is of the essence. You all right, Dexter? Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I am not a killer. I'm partial to air conditioning.</p>
			<p>Cops, another community I'm not part of. He taught me a code. To survive. I'm partial to air conditioning. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm generally confused most of the time.</p>
			<p>This man is a knight in shining armor. Cops, another community I'm not part of. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I like seafood. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</p>
			<p>I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm really more an apartment person. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!</p>
			<p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I am not a killer. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
